# Manatee UI

Manatee UI is an open source React component library focused on unconventional 'pretty' components that are completely customizable. Tested with React Testing Library and Jest.

## Play with each component in a live environment

Check the live playground for each component including its documentation on the library's bit page: https://bit.dev/lietsaki/manatee-ui

## Ã€ la carte components

Make your bundle smaller by including only the components you need instead of the whole library. For example, to download `ui-button1` with npm, you can run:

`npm i @bit/lietsaki.manatee-ui.ui-button1`

See the snippet to install each component in their bit.dev page!
